# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a PhD student in Electronic Information at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, starting from 2024, supervised by Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/), with guidance from Dr. [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/) and Dr. [Wenlong Zhang](https://wenlongzhang0517.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology ([rank 1/196](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YOJcpipRe0TgYSeJgOCwCA#:~:text=%E4%BB%B2%E8%8B%B1%E4%B9%A6%E9%99%A2-,%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA004%E7%8F%AD%C2%A0%E5%BE%90%E6%9C%9B%E7%80%9A,-%F0%9F%94%B5%20%E8%BF%9E%E7%BB%AD%E4%B8%A4%E5%B9%B4)) from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models, Multi-Agent Systems, [AI Scientists](https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist/), and Generative AI. My current focus is on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of AI models in complex problem-solving scenarios, including multidisciplinary knowledge reasoning, [deep research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) and automated scientific discovery.
