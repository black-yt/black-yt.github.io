# 👋 About Me

I am a PhD student in Electronic Information at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, starting from 2024, supervised by Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/), with guidance from Dr. [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/) and Dr. [Wenlong Zhang](https://wenlongzhang0517.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xi’an Jiaotong University.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models, Multi-Agent Systems, [AI Scientists](https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist/), and Generative AI. My current focus is on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of AI models in complex problem-solving scenarios, including multidisciplinary knowledge reasoning, [deep research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) and automated scientific discovery.

If you are interested in multi-agent systems on deep research or scientific discovery, feel free to contact me at [xu_wanghan@sjtu.edu.cn](xu_wanghan@sjtu.edu.cn).
