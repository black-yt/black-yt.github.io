# 👋 About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Electronic Information at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, starting from 2024, supervised by Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xi’an Jiaotong University.

My research interests lie in AI for Science, Large Language Models, Multi-Agent Systems, and Generative AI. My current focus is on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of AI models in complex problem-solving scenarios, including multidisciplinary knowledge reasoning, deep research and automated scientific discovery.

If you are interested in multi-agent systems on deep research or scientific discovery, feel free to contact me at `xu_wanghan@sjtu.edu.cn`.
